### 3D Design

In this class, our objective was to make and print a 3D object using either the Prusa i3 MK2 or the Ultimaker 2+. I used the Ultimaker becuase my Cura app was preset to it. I designed a pretty basic shape which was an extruded rectangle with fileted edges. We used Fusion 360 for this and exported it into a .stl file format. This was then opened in the Cura application which converted it into g code. This was transferred into an SD card that was plugged into the printer. The printer has to reach 200 degrees Fahrenheit because it has to melt the PLA plastic that is used. The Prusa is also calibrated and the nozzle height is adjusted to get the optimum print quality which is not possible on the Ultimaker. My print took about 11 minutes but if I had changed the quality (for examole to draft) it would have been faster although I would sacrifice some print quality. 

<!-- Or, you can also directly include HTML, for example to make a split image -->

<img src="3d.JPG" alt="3D PRINT" style="height: 400px; max-width: 400%">

The printer also pringted a base for the shape to remain balanced. If it had been printed horizontally it would have taken a shorter amount of time and I would have ended up with the same thing.
