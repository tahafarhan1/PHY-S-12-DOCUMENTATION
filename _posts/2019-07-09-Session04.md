### 2D Design and Cutting

In this lab we used the laser cutter and the drill to cut out different patterns and shapes out of cardboard and plywood.

### Laser Cutter

The laser cutter can be used to cut out shapes that can then be joined together to form 3D objects. For this we used Autodesk Fusion 360 to make 2D designs that we could then extrude to form 3D shapes that can be cut out. In order to use the laser cutter we had to follow a certain order of steps that can be seen in the next picture.

I used Fusion 360 to make a 4-pointed shape that I then cut 8 copies off out of cardboard to try and make a 3D object out of. However I forgot to account for curf so when I joined them together they were very loose and kept falling out.
