### Deciding on an idea

At the start of the program, I had had the idea of making a bluetooth robot that followed you around using an app on your phone. It was supposed to use a bluetooth module with multiple sensors and motors and was supposed to look like the video below.

</video>


 However, it proved to be too complicated that by the midterm week I had totally given up on it. Then when when we were using electronic output devices in session 9
 I had the idea of making a car for the final. It was going to use two DC motors, two laser cut wheels, and was only going to work when the light flashing on the light sensor exceeded a certain value.
