### Final Project Ideas

1. My first idea is to make an autonomous robot that follows a person around by connecting to your smartphone via bluetooth and uses GPS to navigate. It can hold objects like coolers and can act as your very own robotic butler.

<!-- You can include comments that will not be translated to HTML -->

<!-- You can include links and images in the following format: -->

[Link Description](url) and ![Alternative text](motor.jpg)


<!-- Or, you can also directly include HTML, for example to make a split image -->

<img src="board1.jpg" alt="Board Traces" style="height: 200px; max-width: 48%">
<img src="board2.jpg" alt="Board Interior" style="height: 200px; max-width: 48%">


<!-- You can also use HTML tags to include a video -->

<!-- Or to add a download link to any (reasonably small) file in your permalink directory -->
