### Cutting Tools

In this class we used various cutting tools from a standard hacksaw to a Japanese pull saw. Different types of saws have to be used for different kinds of materials. The two major saws we used for cutting wood are: the Japanese (nokogiri) pull saw and the European push saw. For cutting plastic: the Japanese pull saw and the hacksaw is used.

In the picture above you see the narrow Japanese Nokogiri pull saw next to the broader push hacksaw. The thin blade of the pull saws can be used to make delicate and precise cuts rather than the rough cuts made by the hacksaw. The motion of the pull saw (towards the body) allows for straighter cuts and achieve a neat finish. The 2 cuts can be compared in the next picture.
